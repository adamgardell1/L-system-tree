# L-system-tree
L-system tree generator with p5.js for course TNM084. Try it here: https://gardelladam.github.io/L-system-tree/

This is a  program for testing different l-systems for generation of geometry, trees in particular.
The program can run in a browser and has a gui including some presets.
The tree is redrawn for each frame, which can cause the web browser to hang if too many iterations are made, so keep down the size of the tree when testing.
